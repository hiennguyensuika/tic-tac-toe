NOTE FOR MYSELF

******************************************************************
/*
The order of Components (Design System Step to start):
1 - Index.js : contains App.js 
_ `<React.StrictMode>`Â is a tool that helps developers write better React code by providing additional checks and warnings during development, allowing them to address potential problems and improve the overall quality of their applications.

2 - App.js : Contains container

3 - App.css : apply for all components (as long as you import it)

4 & 5 - Square.js and Board.js : adding function component handleClick into Board.js's elements

6 - Game.js: all the main functions to play

7 - History.js: record 

*/

Note for myself
_ Why could not set span and ClassName for "Move" like "Go To Game" . How ?
<!-- History js - Line 10 /*const desc = move ? "Move "+ move : <span className="game-start"> GO TO GAME START</span>;*/ 

_ Responsive Css
